# Example: Simple Neural Network Experiment

Train a neural network to learn the XOR function as a minimal test case.

## Objective
Demonstrate that a 2-layer network can learn XOR (which is not linearly separable).

## Constraints
- Keep it minimal (< 100 lines of code)
- Should train in < 1 minute
- Use only CPU (no GPU needed)

## Success Criteria  
- Loss should drop below 0.01
- Network should correctly predict all 4 XOR cases
- Training should complete without errors

## Why This Example?
This is a perfect test case because:
1. It's simple enough to debug quickly
2. It tests that nonlinear learning works
3. It runs fast with minimal resources
